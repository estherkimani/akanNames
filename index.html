    <h1>Akan Names</h1>
    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which
      corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The name is also dependent on the child's gender. That way, men have different names from
      women.</p>
